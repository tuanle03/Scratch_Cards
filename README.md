# Scratch Card Game https://game-card.herokuapp.com
This project is focused on building a networked game for scratch cards, where players can play a traditional button-counting game but with the added twist of using six cards instead of three. The game will be built using Ruby on Rails framework for web development.

## Requirements
In order to run this project, you will need:

- Ruby on Rails (version 7.0 or higher)
- A web server: Heroku and Pusher for Websocket
- A database management enviroment system: PostgreSQL on Production and SQLite3 on Development

## Getting Started
1. To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/tuanle03/Scratch_Cards.git
```

2. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
bundle install
```

3. Next, you will need to set up the database by running the following commands:

```
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

4. Finally, start the web server by running:

```
rails server
```

5. You should now be able to access the game by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `app/controllers` contains the controllers for the game logic.
